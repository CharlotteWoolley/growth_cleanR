# growth_cleanR
This repository contains code for our recommended algorithm (NLME-A), capable of data cleaning growth measurements in a broad spectrum of domains. It also contains code for several other data cleaning methods for growth and compares their effectiveness to our method by simulating errors in a publicly available pre-cleaned human weight measurement dataset known as 'CLOSER', obtained from the UK data archive<sup>1</sup>.                              

The code contained in this repository is supplementary material for our publication<sup>2</sup>, which provides further details about the methodologies used.
